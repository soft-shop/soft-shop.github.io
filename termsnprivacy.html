                    <h3>3. Disclaimer</h3>
                    <ol type="a">

                            purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of rights.</li>
                        <li>Further, Soft Shop LLC does not warrant or make any representations concerning the accuracy, likely
                            results, or reliability of the use of the materials on its website or otherwise relating to such
